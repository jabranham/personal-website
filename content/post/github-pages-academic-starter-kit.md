title: A github pages starter kit for academic websites
---

A few people have told me that my previous
[blog post]({{< relref "post/making-academic-website.md" >}}) has really
helped them out. I've also noticed that my own website occasionally
gets cloned. I've done quite a bit with my website, though, so it's
not quite as "clean" as I'd like it to be, were I showing someone how
to get their own site set up. 

To that end, I created a
[github pages academic starter kit](https://github.com/jabranham/github-pages-academic-starter-kit)
repository on github that you can fork and clone to get started with
your own website as quickly as possible. Feel free to let me know any
issues you run into!
