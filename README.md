This is my personal website. It's hosted at
[www.jabranham.com](www.jabranham.com)

Feel free to fork this project in order to get your own site going (I
have a
[blog post](http://jabranham.com/blog/2016/01/making-academic-website.html)
that should help you get started), but please note the license
(below). Additionally, you'll want to remove the google file.
Otherwise, I'll get analytic data from your site.
